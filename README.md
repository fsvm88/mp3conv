Old script to convert (almost) anything to \*.mp3

**WARNING: UNMAINTAINED SCRIPT AHEAD.**

Script for conversion of most audio formats (anything *lame* will accept) to \*.mp3.

This is an old and no-more useful script to convert anything the *lame* encoder will accept into \*.mp3. This originated by the need to listen to music on my first (and very old) mp3 player, that couldn't properly accept many "non-standard" mp3 encodings (and many other audio formats, for that matter).

**This is NOT maintained anymore. Last modifications were done in 2008 IIRC.**

This script is here just for *reference* and to serve as an *example* for bash coding.
